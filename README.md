# TUI-GUI
Text User Interfaces for Graphical User Interfaces

The textualwm.py one uses PyPI package textual version 0.26.0

Although I'm certain later versions will work as well, so long as the API doesn't change for the Screen object and TextLog widget

Note: As of 8/23/2023 the TextLog widget was renamed to just Log, so I guess an update is in order

As of 9/29/2023 I have added textualeditor.py and textualeditor.tcss with texual version 0.38.1
