# TUI-GUI
Text User Interfaces for Graphical User Interfaces

The textualwm.py one uses PyPI package 'textual' version 0.41 and 'textual-terminal' version 0.3

Although I'm certain later versions will work as well, so long as the API doesn't change for the Screen object and Terminal widget

textualeditor.py and textualeditor.tcss use texual version 0.38.1
